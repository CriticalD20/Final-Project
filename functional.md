# The Long Dark Text Recreation



## Functional Specification

My program is a text-based recreation of a game call The Long Dark. In the game, the player will be asked multiple choice questions about where they would like to go within the provided answers. The end goal is to find the house which means some-what certain survival. Otherwise, the player will die of cold or by wolves. 
Each description of the areas are printed into the text area, while choices are provided as input boxes where they will type in one of their choices represented as the lowercase letter of their choice. In the intrduction,there are inputs for the player to read about the game, but there are no text requirements for them. 
Users can access my program through a web page link or through my public GitHub Account. This program does not use any graphics screens or mouse input. However, it does require keyboard input in order to pick the choices the player would like to make. No graphical assets are used, and this program requires nothing to be installed. 
This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:
